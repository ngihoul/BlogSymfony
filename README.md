Blog in Symfony [in progress]
======

This project was done as part of the "**OOP & Framework**" course during my last and third year of a BES in Web
Development.

In order to master the basics of Symfony, we had to create a Blog and implement some features like :

* Route management
* CRUD for the different entities
* Relations between entities
* User authentication
* User registration
* Use of the firewall
* etc.

### Used technologies

* PHP 8.0.12
* MySQL 8.0
* Symfony 5.3.10
* CSS3
